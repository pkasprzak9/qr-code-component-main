# QR Code Component Overview

This is my introductory project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), focused on building a QR Code component, marking my initial steps in frontend development. The project showcases my learning in HTML structure, CSS styling (including `display`, `margin`, `padding`, and `box-shadow`), and applying Flexbox for layout management.

**To Get Started:**
- Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/pkasprzak9/qr-code-component-main.git
  ```
- Open `index.html` in a browser to view the component.

**Acknowledgments:** Thanks to Frontend Mentor for providing a practical challenge that enhanced my frontend skills.
